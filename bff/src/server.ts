   * all-in-one image ships 736 KB of JS and CSS on a cold load where the split layout shipped 261 KB, and

   * No explicit type list: the plugin compresses whatever mime-db marks compressible, which is a superset
   * of nginx's five and includes text/html, which nginx only covered implicitly. Brotli is offered first
   * and is something nginx never had here at all -- `nginx:1.27-alpine` ships no brotli module.
   *
   * `@fastify/compress` also sets `Vary: Accept-Encoding`, which nginx did NOT: it ran `gzip on` with no
   * `gzip_vary`, so a shared cache in front of it could hand a gzipped body to a client that never asked
   * for one. This is parity plus that fix.
